What is CSS
● CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
● If HTML is the structure of the house then CSS is the look and feel of the house
● It’s the language to make our web pages presentable
● Designed to make style sheets for web
● Now let’s try to break the acronym:
Cascading: Falling of Styles
Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags
Sheets: Writing our style in different documents
